### Question 4

**Question**:
Potential jurors in most Pennsylvania counties are sampled randomly from a list of county residents who are registered voters or licensed drivers over age 18. In 2017, 1,224,826 jury summons were mailed to residents of Pennsylvania on the list. About 91,000 of those were returned from the post office as undeliverable; for another 284,000 of the summons, no one responded. Approximately 153,000 persons were unqualified for service because they were not citizens, were under 18, were convicted felons, or had other reasons that disqualified them from serving on a jury. An additional 187,000 were exempted or excused from jury service because of age, illness, financial hardship, military service, or another acceptable reason. The final sample consisted of 246,000 persons who were told to report for service and reported.
